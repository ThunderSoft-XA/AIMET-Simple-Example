## AIMET Setup Developer documentation

The main purpose of this project is to guide users to quickly master AIMET APIs, so that users can optimize their models more smoothly.

This is my first time using AIMET, so I chose a slightly simpler example so that we can understand how to use AIMET. 

Due to the problem of my network and host resources, I installed the 1.16.2.py37 version of torch_cpu on the host using conda. This is not the official recommended installation method, so I introduced this installation method in detail in the document, and I think this method should be universally applicable. 

## The main development process:
* Build aimet environment in conda 
* Prepare the data set and execute the openpose example
